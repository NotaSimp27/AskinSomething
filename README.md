**Yes and No Question**

Overview

This is a web application designed for a playful interaction where you can ask your partner out maybe. The app features a humorous twist: when the partner tries to press "No," the button moves around, making it only possible to press "Yes." It's a fun way to express your affection and propose to your partner.

Features

Interactive Button: The "No" button moves around the screen to make it challenging to click, while the "Yes" button remains in place.
Simple and Fun: The web app is designed to be simple and fun, making the experience lighthearted and engaging.

Getting Started

Usage

When the web page loads, you will see two buttons: "Yes" and "No."

The "Yes" button remains in place and can be clicked easily.
